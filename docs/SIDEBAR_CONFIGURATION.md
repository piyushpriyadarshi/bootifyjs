# Sidebar Configuration Guide

## Current Status

The sidebar configuration in `sidebars.ts` is currently set to **autogenerated mode** to work with the existing tutorial content. This is a temporary configuration.

## Complete Navigation Structure

The complete sidebar structure for BootifyJS documentation has been defined in `sidebars.ts` but is currently commented out. It includes three main sidebars:

1. **docsSidebar** - Main documentation with sections:

   - Getting Started
   - Core Concepts
   - Modules (Core, Events, Cache, Logging, Auth, Config)
   - Advanced Topics
   - Guides
   - Contributing

2. **apiSidebar** - API Reference documentation:

   - Decorators
   - Core API
   - Events API
   - Cache API
   - Logging API
   - Auth API
   - Config API

3. **templatesSidebar** - Code templates:
   - REST API
   - Authentication
   - CRUD Operations
   - Event-Driven
   - Caching Patterns
   - Error Handling
   - Middleware
   - Testing
   - Database Integration
   - Full Application

## Activating the Complete Structure

Once the documentation files are created (tasks 3-21), follow these steps:

1. Open `docs/sidebars.ts`
2. Remove the autogenerated configuration:
   ```typescript
   docsSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
   apiSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
   templatesSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
   ```
3. Uncomment the complete sidebar structure (marked with `/* ... */`)
4. Test the build with `npm run build`

## Footer Links

The footer links in `docusaurus.config.ts` are currently set to reference only existing pages. Once the documentation structure is complete, update the footer to include:

```typescript
footer: {
  style: 'dark',
  links: [
    {
      title: 'Docs',
      items: [
        { label: 'Getting Started', to: '/docs/getting-started/installation' },
        { label: 'Core Concepts', to: '/docs/core-concepts/overview' },
        { label: 'API Reference', to: '/docs/api-reference/decorators' },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Resources',
      items: [
        { label: 'Templates', to: '/docs/templates/rest-api' },
        { label: 'Guides', to: '/docs/guides/comparison' },
        { label: 'Advanced Topics', to: '/docs/advanced/custom-middleware' },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Community',
      items: [
        { label: 'GitHub', href: 'https://github.com/piyushpriyadarshi/bootifyjs' },
        { label: 'Issues', href: 'https://github.com/piyushpriyadarshi/bootifyjs/issues' },
        { label: 'Discussions', href: 'https://github.com/piyushpriyadarshi/bootifyjs/discussions' },
      ],
    },
  ],

}
```

## Navbar Configuration

The navbar is already configured with the three main navigation items:

- **Docs** - Links to docsSidebar
- **API Reference** - Links to apiSidebar
- **Templates** - Links to templatesSidebar

These will automatically work once the documentation files are created and the sidebar structure is activated.
